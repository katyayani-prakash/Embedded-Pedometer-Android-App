# Embedded-Pedometer-Android-App

In this assignment, we have extended our earlier pedometer application to develop it into an embedded android application for a pedometer that connects to a Thunderboard over Bluetooth, reads the accelerometer data from the board and transmits it over to the smartphone app. The app scans for Bluetooth devices, recognizes the Thunderboard by itâ€™s address, and enables a connect button which establishes connection between the phone and board. This project, thus, demonstrates BLE connection and how to establish that in Android. The app has a very real-world application in IoT with fitness bands and watches, that track steps on these devices and transmit them over to their smartphone apps (e.g. Fitbit).
